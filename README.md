As described in the KidsCanCode tutorial and in the demonstration video, this script uses a Recursive Backtracker algorithm to produce a fully-connected randomized maze. Run the res://Maze/Maze.tscn scene and see the resulting maze. The contents of Maze.gd would be a great snippet to add to your gists.

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, add a summary message, commit your changes and push them back to GitHub. If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-05a-Procedural-Generation) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing the "Created by" information with your name):
